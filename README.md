# DIY Automatic locks
## Rear hatch
The lock cylinder in the hatch was completely siezed. This was not remedied by graphite lock lubricant, penetrating oil, or removal of salts with CLR. My car only has manual locks, and the central locking upgrade is far too much for my ~220k km finMobile. So I bought some micro servos, an rfid reader, and spun up my own solution.
